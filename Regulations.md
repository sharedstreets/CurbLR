# About regulations

For a given location, a regulation defines _what_ is allowed or prohibited at a section of curb, _when_, for _whom_, as
well as _how_ the regulation should be applied. The regulation(s) are always expressed as an array in order to provide a
consistent format regardless of whether a given street segment has a single or multiple regulations. This prevents the
need to repeat geometry and location data multiple times for the same street segment.

A regulation has several parts:

* [Rule](Rule.md) Specifies a single type of activity (parking, standing, or loading) that is permitted or forbidden,
  along with essential conditions like the maximum stay. The rule is applied when the restriction is in effect.
* [UserClasses](UserClasses.md): Defines what types of vehicles, permits, and modes to whom this regulation applies
* [TimeSpans](TimeSpans.md): Defines one or more date and time periods when this regulation is in effect
* [Payment](Payment.md): Provides optional, supplemental information about a payment profile and how it is applied

# Overlapping regulations and hierarchy

It is possible for more than one regulation to apply to the same section of a street. For example, a section of curb may
be a loading zone during the morning, a paid parking zone during the afternoon, and a free parking zone in the evening.
A stretch of curb may be regulated for two-hour parking normally, but during a snow emergency that regulation is
superseded by a no parking regulation. Or a temporary regulation might be put into place to disallow parking in a
construction zone.

To resolve potential conflicts when regulations overlap one another, a descriptive priority category is included as part
of each regulation (in the [Rule](Rule.md)), and the [metadata](Manifest.md) includes an ordered list of these priority
categories, establishing a hierarchy. Using this category approach enables data creators to prevent ambiguity or
conflicts between overlapping regulations, in a way that allows for flexibility, customization, the ability to adapt to
future changes.
