The examples below include the regulation described by the sign, as well as sample GeoJSON coordinates and location
properties. In any of these examples, the `priorityHierarchy` in the [metadata](../Manifest.md) should list all the
priority categories included in the CurbLR feed, placed in order from highest priority to lowest.

# Time limited parking with permit exemption, planned to take effect 2020-02-20

Any vehicle may park at this location, but vehicles without an 'F' or 'N' permit are limited to 2 hours between 9am and
6pm Monday through Friday. (The sign does not indicate whether parking is permitted outside the specified time range -
the "default" rule must be determined based on local context.)

_[In this example, both rules have the same `priorityCategory` but they do not conflict because one of the rules has a userClass. However, a user could create a separate priorityCategory (e.g. "restricted parking", "permit parking", or "resident parking") if desired; the categories used in this documentation are just examples and can be modified as desired.]_

# Time limited parking with permit exemption and multiple no parking periods

No vehicles may park between 6pm and 8am daily due to overnight parking restrictions, or between 1pm and 3pm on
Wednesday for street cleaning. Between 8am and 6pm, vehicles without a Zone 5 permit are limited to two hours.

_[This example does not use the `paid parking` priority category described in other examples because it would supercede the permit parking (implying that users had to pay regardless of permit status). Depending on a city's context and how it plans to map rules, a user could create a hybrid "paid or permit parking" category, two separate categories for permit and paid parking, or could combine all these rules into "parking".]_

# School loading zone, time limited parking with permit exemption, and multiple no parking periods

On school days only 5 minute passenger loading is permitted from 6:30am to 9am and from 1:30pm to 4pm. No vehicles may
park between 6pm and 8am daily due to overnight parking restrictions, or between 10am and 1pm on Monday for street
cleaning. Between 8am and 6pm, vehicles without a Zone 64 permit are limited to 2 hours.

_[Note: The school day regulation overlaps with both the overnight no parking and the 2-hour allowed parking regulations. To avoid ambiguity about which rule is in effect, the school day regulation is given a higher priority than the other regulations.]_
