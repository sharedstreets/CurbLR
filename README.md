# What is CurbLR?

CurbLR is a data standard for describing curb regulations. It exists to help government effectively manage and regulate
the curb and to support public and private users of city streets.

CurbLR provides a structured, standardized format that can be used by government agencies, citizens, and companies who
want to store and share information about curb regulations, regardless of whether the data are gathered through mapping,
crowdsourcing, or machine learning techniques. It uses linear referencing to link regulation information back to the street.

CurbLR is a common language on which many things can be built, including rules engines, query APIs, consumer
notification services, mapping tools, and analytic models.

# Design principles

1. ***Machine-readable:*** From navigation apps to connected cars, urban mobility is increasingly digital. CurbLR helps
   computers understand the curb, whether that's answering real-time questions like "where's the nearest place to drop
   off a passenger?" or modeling parking allocation scenarios for an entire neighborhood.

2. ***Human-accessible:*** Curbs are managed and used by people, so CurbLR must be useful to humans and not just
   machines. CurbLR is designed to be directly readable and writable by people with technical training, and to support
   tools that make it accessible to the non-technical.

3. ***Achievable:*** Most curb management is not digitized today and this won't change overnight. To ease this
   transition, it must be possible to take existing signs and translate them into CurbLR, even if some desired data
   fields are unknown.

4. ***Adaptable:*** No two cities manage their curb in exactly the same way. CurbLR is built to support many types of
   regulations and management practices. A city should not have to change its curb regulations to use CurbLR.

5. ***Essential but not exhaustive:*** CurbLR is not the appropriate place to store exhaustive information that would
   not be consumed by others outside the city (for example, the date when a parking sign was last replaced). This
   information can be maintained separately and linked to the curb regulation data - in the same way that GTFS contains
   essential information about a transit system, but doesn't capture every bit of the transit agency's data.

6. ***Reversible:*** Cities can convert parking regulations into a CurbLR feed, and can also reverse this to link back
   to their original data.

7. ***Consumption-oriented:*** Government agencies typically maintain data about physical assets, which are easily
   managed in GIS systems and are the simplest format for an agency to update over time. CurbLR describes regulatory
   geometries, which requires a more complicated data model and a GeoJSON format. In order to fully capture essential
   data, the spec is difficult to edit and maintain directly in a GIS system. Therefore, CurbLR is intended as a format
   for cities to publish and share curb regulation data with outside agencies or private companies. The structure and
   details of the spec follow this logic. In addition, since public agencies producing data often have fewer technical
   resources than private companies consuming data, CurbLR strives to avoid burdensome data requirements for cities by
   focusing on basic asset data. Wherever possible, CurbLR avoids data processing and interpolation, leaving these
   issues for engineering teams on the consumption side of the workflow.

8. ***B2B-oriented:*** CurbLR is intended as a format for cities to share data that can be used in routing apps, payment
   services, visualization and analysis tools, etc. It is intended as a B2B exchange format, with the assumption that
   each individual service or app would choose its own means to store, integrate, query, and serve out the data to end
   users. To make this simple, we kept CurbLR as a single file with a denormalized structure. We chose not to break
   CurbLR into multiple files, like GTFS, that require a database structure to interpret. Ultimately we decided that the
   burdens for consumers working with denormalized data outweighed the desire to keep file sizes small and avoid
   repetition. We recognize that some may disagree with this design decision, but it was made with careful
   consideration.

9. ***Future-friendly:*** How we use the curb is changing. Cities are adjusting parking prices based on demand, new
   transportation services are arriving on our streets, and vehicles without humans behind the wheel will one day
   deliver people and goods to the curb. CurbLR exists to help make these futures a reality and will grow and adapt as
   urban mobility evolves.

# Approach

CurbLR structures every curb regulation as having three components: the [GeoJSON feature](GeoJsonGeometry.md),
the [location properties](Location.md), and the [regulation](Regulations.md) that applies. While the regulation is
relatively straightforward to describe, location is more difficult.

Curb regulations are usually represented by physical assets like parking signs and curb markings that describe where the
regulation applies. These signs can be mapped using their geographic coordinates.

The assets themselves are easy to map, but the concepts they represent are not. Curb regulations donâ€™t have a perfect,
1:1 relationship with physical space. They represent **regulatory geometries**, not physical geometries.

CurbLR uses asset data as the building blocks for a spec, but supplements it with additional location information and structure.

CurbLR requires users to reference asset data to their location along a street, using
the [SharedStreets Referencing System](https://github.com/sharedstreets/sharedstreets-ref-system). Individual asset
locations are given the SharedStreets Reference ID for the street on which they are located, along with their location
along it. Points can be extrapolated into line segments by setting a particular width for each type of regulation, by
including information about sign relationships along a street, or by estimating based on similar metadata. This enables
asset-based point or line data to be converted into street-linked data.

Here's a visual overview:

SharedStreets references can be regenerated at any time, and individual assets can be edited without impacting the rest
of the data. This provides a stable, interoperable way to convert the location of a parking sign into the regulatory
geometry that it represents.

With location taken care of, the rest of a curb regulation is relatively straightforward to describe, using categories
to capture what, where, to whom, and how the regulation should be applied.

# Data model

CurbLR groups regulations into several categories, focusing on **where** the regulation occurs, **what** it restricts or
permits, **when**, **to whom**, and **how**, it applies, and how it relates to overlapping regulation.

These categories are described below:

| Category                                                    | Importance | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
|:------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Manifest](Manifest.md)                                     | Required   | Contains metadata properties that apply to all regulations, such as the date when the feed was created                                                          |
| [GeoJSON feature](GeoJsonGeometry.md)                       | Required   | Describes the street segment as it will appear on a map. All GeoJson features are LineStrings containing coordinates and the fields listed below in this table. |
| GeoJsonProperties.[Location](Location.md)                   | Required   | Describes the location (street-linked point or street segment) **where** the regulation applies, using geographic information and linear referencing.           |
| GeoJsonProperties.[Regulations](Regulations.md)             | Required   | Describes the curb usage regulation(s) that are in place for the location                                                                                       |
| GeoJsonProperties.Regulations.[Rule](Rule.md)               | Required   | Determines **what** is allowed or forbidden in the zone during a particular period of time                                                                      |
| GeoJsonProperties.Regulations.[UserClasses](UserClasses.md) | Optional   | Defines **who** the regulations applies to. Can be used to denote categories of users such as permit holders, vehicle types, or vehicle function                |
| GeoJsonProperties.Regulations.[TimeSpans](TimeSpans.md)     | Optional   | Defines the time period **when** a zone regulation is in effect                                                                                                 |
| GeoJsonProperties.Regulations.[Payment](Payment.md)         | Optional   | Provides a structure to store additional information about fees that may be required in order to use a given curbspace                                          |
| GeoJsonProperties.[Images](Images.md)                       | Optional   | Provides link(s) to image(s) of street assets that communicate the regulations to curbspace users, such as a street sign, parking meter, or fire hydrant        |

The feed as a whole is a JSON file. The curb geometries and properties are stored as GeoJSON features that form one
GeoJSON object. Above this in the file, the CurbLR feed will contain metadata properties, stored as
a [manifest](Manifest.md), which is a JSON object.

The example below shows the structure of one feature in the feed:

# Origins

CurbLR is based on the design and thinking laid out in [CurbSpec](https://github.com/jfh01/CurbSpec). At SharedStreets,
we spoke with a handful of cities across the US, reviewed their parking regulation datasets, conducted field mapping in
a local area to experience data collection, and converted
an [initial dataset of ~35,000 Los Angeles parking zones](/conversions) into the CurbSpec format. To our knowledge, this
was the first attempt to convert a curb regulation dataset into CurbSpec. When trying to convert GIS data into the spec,
we realized that several significant modifications were needed, including:

- Adding location information for the regulation (both geographic and with
  the [SharedStreets linear referencing system](https://sharedstreets.io/how-the-sharedstreets-referencing-system-works/).
- Structuring regulations as a GeoJSON object, and in a flatter manner (one curb activity per feature)
- Using a well-known values approach to avoid free-form text where possible
- Adding metadata to describe the agency that created the data, and other relevant aspects that apply across a CurbLR
  feed
- Adding a structured, but optional, place for data such as payment information and asset information, which is required
  for some consumption efforts

The addition of linear-referenced location information was a significant change that is critical to how the spec
functions. Because of this change, we chose to rename this spec as CurbLR.

# Potential future enhancements

* **External referencing for designated periods**: Extend [TimeSpan](TimeSpans.md) to allow arbitrarily designated
  periods (e.g. "Snow Emergency" or "School Days") to be specifically defined via a static or dynamic (API) referencing
  system

* **Transactional data**: Structure to facilitate the inclusion of transaction or session data

* **Cross-jurisdictional allowed use mapping**: A mechanism to establish defaults and
  translate [Regulations](Regulations.md) (which are locally defined in their meaning) into a standardized,
  cross-jurisdictional list of activities. This would, for example, allow automated interpretation of local regulations
  to determine where activities like passenger loading could take place.
