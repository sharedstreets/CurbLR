# About payment

The payment object indicates whether payment is required and stores information that can be used to calculate the fee
required for a given time and stay, and how the payment may be made. CurbLR does not, at this time, store information
sufficient to facilitate dynamic pricing.

Fees for parking or other street usage can be sorted into three categories, borrowed from
the [Alliance for Parking Data Standards'](https://www.allianceforparkingdatastandards.org/resources) Release 2.0:

| Rate type      | Description                                                                                                                                                                   | Example                                                                                                                                                            |
|:---------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Flat-rate      | A fixed amount is charged for a period of time, irrespective of the day, time, or actual length of stay.                                                                      | The fee is $1 per hour, for any part of that hour                                                                                                                  |
| Flat-rate tier | A fixed amount is charged for an initial period of time. The amount changes for successive periods. The fee schedule may vary based on duration of stay, time of day, or both | In the first hour of a parking session, the fee is $1 for any part of that hour; in the second hour of a parking session, the fee is $2 for any part of that hour. |
| Incrementing   | Same as flat-rate tier, but intended to be used for smaller amounts of time, such as 5-minute periods                                                                         | The fee is 5 cents for the first 5 mins, 10 cents for the next 5 mins, 25 cents for the next 10 mins, 50 cents for the next 15 mins                                |

These fields are stored as key:value pairs in a pricing object in the spec.

Fees may also vary based on time of day. To address this, users can include a [TimeSpan](TimeSpans.md) object within the
payment object.

Data fields should generally be considered case insensitive since they are used programmatically; we use lower-case in
our examples, except for fields that would be used for display purposes (such as a street name or agency name).

## Flat-rate

Describes a parking meter. The fee is $1 for any part of an hour.

```json
{
  "payment": {
    "rates": [
      {
        "fees": [1],
        "durations": [60]
      }
    ],
    "methods": ["meter"],

    "operator": "LADOT",
    "phone": "+15552225039",
    "deviceIds": ["MB-2038"]
  }
}
```

## Flat-rate tier, based on duration

Describes a parking meter. In the first hour of a parking session, the fee is $1 for any part of that hour; in the
second hour of a parking session, the fee is $2 for any part of that hour.

```json
{
  "payment": {
    "rates": [
      {
        "fees": [1, 2],
        "durations": [60, 60]
      }
    ],
    "methods": ["meter", "digital"],
    "forms": ["coins", "Mastercard", "Visa", "American Express", "Discover", "ApplePay", "AndroidPay"],
    "operator": "LADOT",
    "phone": "+15552225039",
    "deviceIds": ["MB-2494"]
  }
}
```

## Incrementing

Describes a parking meter. The fee is 5 cents for the first 5 mins, 10 cents for the next 5 mins, 25 cents for the next
10 mins, 50 cents for the next 15 mins.

```json
{
  "payment": {
    "rates": {
      "fees": [0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5],
      "durations": [5, 5, 10, 15]
    },
    "methods": ["meter"],
    "forms": ["coins", "MasterCard", "Visa", "American Express", "Discover", "ApplePay", "AndroidPay"],
