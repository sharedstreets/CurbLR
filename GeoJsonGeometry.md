# GeoJSON feature geometries

Each regulation must be associated with a geographic feature, which must be a line segment (`LineString`). The
geographic coordinates for the points that comprise this feature are contained within the `Feature` of
a `Feature Class`. The coordinates should be based on the _matched SharedStreets output, not the input data_. This
ensures that the resulting feature geometries have been snapped to the street and can be displayed on a map
consistently.

For a primer on GeoJSON terminology and structure, see [this post](https://macwright.org/2015/03/23/geojson-second-bite.html). For a more in depth 
description [the geojson website](https://geojson.org/) and the [full RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946) are good resources.

Each geographic coordinate should have no more than 7 decimal places of precision. This is sufficient to describe a
location with ~1.1 cm accuracy. Further precision is unnecessary; less is sufficient.

Here's an example of the geometry of a GeoJSON feature. Note that the coordinates are for the signpost's location _after
it was snapped to the street and extrapolated into a street segment_:

```json
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "LineString",
    "coordinates": [
      [
        -112.1258855,
        33.4513431
      ],
      [
        -112.1253007,
        33.4513208
      ]
    ],
    "properties": {
    }
  }
}
```
