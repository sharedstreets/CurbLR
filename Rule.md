# About rules

A rule is a subsection of the [regulations](Regulations.md). It groups properties that define _what_ activity is allowed
or prohibited at a section of curb, _why_, and pertinent information about _how_ the regulation applies (whether there
is a time limit or maximum time before returning). Additional object properties grouped elsewhere in the spec further
define [_when_](TimeSpans.md) and [_to whom_](UserClasses.md) the regulation applies, whether and how
much [payment](Payment.md) is required, as well as the [_priority_](Priority.md) level of the regulation.

# Definition

Each GeoJSON feature may have the following properties:

This describes why the activity rule is in place. All unique `priorityCategory` values in a CurbLR feed must be listed in a prioritized order in the [metadata](Manifest.md). This list creates a hierarchy that can be used to determine which regulation takes precedence when there are overlapping rules. The [metadata](Manifest.md) includes an example ordered list. | `game day`             |

Data fields should generally be considered case insensitive since they are used programmatically; we use lower-case in
our examples, except for fields that would be used for display purposes (such as a street name or agency name).

## Activity: possible values

CurbLR assumes that all activities along the curb fit into three categories:

* **Parking:** Stopping a vehicle and leaving it unattended
* **Standing:** Stopping a vehicle but leaving it attended
* **Loading:** Stopping a vehicle (attended or unattended) to perform a loading activity. The vehicle may remain in the
  curb section _only_ while the loading activity occurs.

Each of these activities can be described in the affirmative (e.g. `parking`) to denote what is permitted, or in the
negative (e.g. `no parking`) to denote what is prohibited. It is not necessary to duplicate an object to define its
inverse. A regulation for a certain type of user implies that no other users can perform that activity in the given
curbspace (unless otherwise specified). For example, `parking` for residential permit holders implies that the curb
segment is a `no parking` zone for any other users.

CurbLR can indicate what regulation is in effect at a given place and time (or that no regulation is in effect). CurbLR
can also indicate a relationship between certain activities, but not others; if a section of curb is described as a
standing or loading zone, this implies that parking is not permitted during that period. Beyond this, local regulation
must determine what specific activities are allowed in a particular section of the curb. For example, local rules may
allow for passenger loading in a "No Parking" zone but not in a "No Stopping" zone.

### Activity classification examples

The activity classifications may be modified to describe myriad activities along the curb. For example:

* Parking meters: Parking zone with required payment; fees may only apply during specified hours. Standing and loading
  may or may not be permitted.
* Residential permit parking: Parking zone for users with residential parking permits. Implies no parking for any other
  users. Standing and loading may or may not be permitted.
* Bus stop: Loading zone for buses. Implies no loading, standing, or parking for any other users.
* Taxi stand: Standing zone for taxis. Implies no loading, standing, or parking for any other users. (Note: This is
  different from a pick-up/drop-off zone since a vehicle may remain at a taxi stand indefinitely while waiting for a
  potential passenger.)
* TNC pick-up/drop-off zone: Loading zone for TNCs. Implies no loading, standing, or parking for any other users.

## Overlapping rules

It is possible for more than one regulation to apply to the same section of a street. For example, a section of curb may
be a loading zone during the morning, a paid parking zone during the afternoon, and a free parking zone in the evening.
A stretch of curb may be regulated for two-hour parking normally, but during a snow emergency that regulation is
superseded by a no parking regulation. Or a temporary regulation might be put into place to disallow parking in a
construction zone.

In the real world, priorities are often implied rather than explicit. Road users assume that a "No Parking - Street
Cleaning" sign overrules a "2H Meter Parking" sign. As computers are not adept at making these kinds of value
judgements, CurbLR requires that priorities be specified explicitly. This allows different regulations to coexist
without ambiguity.

The `priorityCategory` exists to resolve these potential conflicts. It is used to assign each regulation a descriptive
category, such as "parking" or "snow emergency zone". The `priorityCategory` will typically be a list of the `activity`
types, plus some special types of rules that may appear temporarily or periodically and should be handled specially.

The priority categories in a CurbLR feed are then placed into a list ordered from highest to lowest priority; this is
the `priorityHierarchy` array in the [metadata](Manifest.md). For example, the `priorityHierarchy` might
be ["street cleaning", "paid parking", "free parking"]. When multiple regulations apply at a specific location and time,
the priority hierarchy determines which one is in force. In this example, street cleaning will supercede paid and free
parking.

An example hierarchy is described below and can be used as a default, or a starting place for creating a feed. The
default hierarchy will apply to most places, but can be customized if a jurisdiction differs from the norm or needs more
flexibility.

### Priority category: Example values

When regulations overlap, the more restrictive activity rule typically supercedes the less restrictive activity rule (
e.g. a "No stopping" zone typically overrides a free parking area). However, cities often create temporary restrictions
or regulations for special events, construction, weather emergencies, etc. These rules are often in effect for irregular
or unpredictable time periods and a city may want to customize how these special rules fit into the hierarchy.

The following is a suggested but not exhaustive list of values for `priorityCategory`; this property should be
customized as needed to describe a city:

- `no standing`
- `snow emergency zone`
- `construction`
- `game day`
- `special event`
- `street cleaning`
- `temporary`
- `standing`
- `no loading`
- `loading`
- `no parking`
- `paid parking` and/or `permit parking`, to be included depending on how the data is mapped and digitized (see next section)
- `parking`

All unique `priorityCategory` values in a CurbLR feed must be listed in the [metadata](Manifest.md), placed in order
from highest to lowest priority. For the example above, this list would be written as 
`priorityHierarchy` = [`no standing`, `snow emergency zone`, `construction`, `game day`, `special event`, `street cleaning`, `temporary`, `standing`, `no loading`, `loading`, `no parking`, `paid parking`, `parking`]

### Priority categories: Visual example

Priority categories aren't just useful for resolving overlapping, conflicting rules. They can also make it easier to
digitize a city's data.

For example, an entire street or set of streets might be regulated as resident parking, but with small spans near fire
hydrants defined with higher priority "no standing" regulations applied, like so:

<img src="images/priority_hydrant_example1.png" width="800">

We assign a descriptive priority category to each, which are then ordered in the priorityHierachy
as ["no standing", "parking"], or similar ("fire hydrant" and "free parking" could be called out specifically, if desired).

Without a priority approach, we would have to digitize each section of the curb individually:

<img src="images/priority_hydrant_example3.png" width="800">

This would become very cumbersome, very quickly - especially in an urban area with many overlapping regulations.

With priority categories, we can digitize the full street as a free parking area, and place more restrictive zones over top:

<img src="images/priority_hydrant_example2.png" width="800">

This provides more flexibility and efficiency when creating and editing CurbLR feeds.
