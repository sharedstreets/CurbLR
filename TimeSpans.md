# About time spans

A TimeSpan defines a contiguous or non-contiguous period of time. It is used to specify when a [Rule](Rule.md) applies,
in order to form a complete [regulation](Regulations.md). It supports variety of different concepts for expressing time
which may be combined together.

Multiple TimeSpans may be combined into the same "clause". Whether these are subject to a logical **AND** operation or a
logical **OR** operation depends on their position within an array. The examples below provide additional context.

Some of the concepts supported by TimeSpan:

| Type                   | Description                                            | Example(s)                                                            |
|:-----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *time of day*          | A span of time during a day                            | `between 7am and 9:30am`                                              |
| *day of week*          | Specific days of the week                              | `Monday` or `Weekdays`                                                |
| *day of month*         | Specific days each month                               | `15th day of month` or `last day of the month` or `odd numbered days` |
| *selected day of week* | Certain days of the week within each month             | `1st and 3rd Friday of the month` or `odd-numbered Thursdays`         |
| *fixed date ranges*    | Specific date ranges                                   | `August 2nd, 2018 through August 5th, 2018`                           |
| *annual date ranges*   | Date ranges that apply every year                      | `April 1st through November 30th`                                     |
| *designated periods*   | Externally-defined named designations for time periods | `Holidays` or `Game Days` or `Snow Emergencies`                       |

# Definition

A GeoJSON feature may include TimeSpans made up of the following fields. The TimeSpan(s) are always expressed as an
array in order to provide a consistent format regardless of whether a given regulation has a single or multiple
TimeSpans. Several fields within the TimeSpan are always expressed as arrays for the same reason.

| Field name                    | Type                                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                | Example                                                                   |

When multiple "clauses" are combined in a single TimeSpan, a logical **AND** operation is applied. For example, a
TimeSpan that includes Wednesdays and the period of February 1st through April 30th specifies all Wednesdays between
February 1st and April 30th. It does not specify all Wednesdays during the year AND all days between February 1st and
April 30th (the equivalent of a logical **OR** operation).

When multiple "clauses" are part of a single TimeSpan field but defined in separate TimeSpans, a logical **OR**operation
is applied. For example, a regulation may contain a TimeSpan that specifies weekdays from 9am-5pm, and another TimeSpan
that specifies weekends from 11-2. See examples below for further clarification.

Data fields should generally be considered case insensitive since they are used programmatically; we use lower-case in
our examples, except for fields that would be used for display purposes (such as a street name or agency name).

### No standing at fire hydrant

TimeSpan applies at all times.

```
{
}
```

### No overnight parking

TimeSpan applies overnight (midnight until 6am).

```json
{
  "timeSpans": [
    {
      "timesOfDay": [
        {"from": "00:00", "to": "06:00"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Rush hour (AM and PM) parking regulation

TimeSpan applies during the morning **and** evening rush hours. Providing the two times of day as separate "clauses" in
an array means that a logical **OR** expression is applied.

```JSON
{
  "timeSpans": [
    {
      "timesOfDay": [
        {"from": "07:30", "to": "09:30"},
        {"from": "16:00", "to": "18:00"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Different weekday and weekend time periods

TimeSpan applies on weekdays from 8am to 8pm, **and** on Sundays from 11am to 8pm. Providing the two times of day as
separate "clauses" in an array means that a logical **OR** expression is applied.

```json
{
  "timeSpans": [
    {
      "daysOfWeek": {
        "days": ["mo", "tu", "we", "th", "fr"]
      },
      "timesOfDay": [
        {"from": "08:00", "to": "20:00"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "daysOfWeek": {
        "days": ["su"]
      },
      "timesOfDay": [
        {"from": "11:00", "to": "20:00"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### No parking during snow emergency

TimeSpan in effect only during a snow emergency.

```json
{
  "timeSpans": [
    {
      "designatedPeriods": [
        {"name": "snow emergency", "apply": "only during"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Meters in effect

TimeSpan applies Monday through Saturday between 8am and 8pm, except holidays.

```json
{
  "timeSpans": [
    {
      "daysOfWeek": {
        "days": ["mo", "tu", "we", "th", "fr", "sa"]
      },
      "timesOfDay": [
        {"from": "08:00", "until": "20:00"}
      ],
      "designatedPeriods": [
        {"name": "holidays", "apply": "except during"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Temporary construction permit

TimeSpan applies during designated construction hours (7am until 7pm) for the days during which the permit is valid (
August 2nd, 2018 through August 5th, 2018).

```json
{
  "timeSpans": [
    {
      "timesOfDay": [
        {"from": "07:00", "to": "19:00"}
      ],
      "effectiveDates": [
        {"from": "2018-08-02", "to": "2018-08-05"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Alternate side parking for overnight snow removal

TimeSpan applies on odd number days between December 1st and March 31st from 1am until 6am.

```json
{
  "timeSpans": [
    {
      "daysOfMonth": ["odd"],
      "timesOfDay": [
        {"from": "01:00", "to": "06:00"}
      ],
      "effectiveDates": [
        {"from": "12-01", "to": "03-31"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Bi-weekly street cleaning

TimeSpan applies between 11am and 1pm on the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of every month between April 1st and November 30th each year.

```json
{
  "timeSpans": [
    {
      "daysOfWeek": {
        "days": ["tu"],
        "occurrencesInMonth": ["2nd", "4th"]
      },
      "timesOfDay": [
