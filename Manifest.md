# About metadata (the manifest)

Agencies creating a CurbLR feed may wish to specify properties that apply across the entire feed. These are included in
a `manifest` that appears at the beginning of the feed. The manifest is a JSON object, and below it is the GeoJSON
object, which contains all of the features (geometries and associated regulations).

# Definition

The manifest JSON object may contain the following properties:
